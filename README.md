# Flutter Driver App 🚗

**Intern Assignment (36 hrs) - Food Delivery Driver Simulation**

A comprehensive food delivery driver application built with Flutter that simulates the complete delivery workflow from order assignment to completion. This project demonstrates real-world mobile development skills including GPS integration, geofencing, navigation, and state management.

## 📱 Features

- **Mock Login System**: Simple email/password authentication
- **Order Management**: View assigned order details with restaurant and customer information
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: GPS location updates every 10 seconds
- **Geofencing**: Smart proximity detection (50m radius) for pickup and delivery
- **Navigation Integration**: Direct Google Maps navigation to destinations
- **Order Flow State Machine**: Complete delivery workflow management
- **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with consistent design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.8.1 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Physical device or emulator for location testing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flutter_driver_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform Setup

#### Android
Location permissions are automatically requested when needed. For best results, test on a physical device.

#### iOS  
Location permissions are handled automatically. Physical device recommended for accurate GPS testing.

## 🔐 Login Credentials

The app uses **mock authentication** - you can enter any email and password to log in. Examples:
- Email: `driver@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

*Note: Any text input will work as this is a demonstration app with no backend validation.*

## 🔍 Assumptions Made

### Technical Assumptions
- **GPS Availability**: Device has GPS capability and location permissions are granted
- **Network Connectivity**: Internet access available for Google Maps integration
- **Testing Environment**: Physical device preferred over simulator for accurate location testing
- **Platform Support**: Focused on Android/iOS mobile platforms (Flutter default)

### Business Logic Assumptions  
- **Single Order**: Driver handles one order at a time (typical for learning/demo purposes)
- **Mock Data**: All order data is hardcoded for demonstration (no real restaurant/customer data)
- **Linear Flow**: Order states progress sequentially (no going backward in process)
- **Geofence Accuracy**: 50-meter radius is sufficient for real-world pickup/delivery validation
- **Session Management**: No persistent login state (resets on app restart)

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Login**: Enter any email and password on the login screen
2. **View Order**: See assigned order details with restaurant and customer information  
3. **Start Journey**: Follow the order flow buttons:
   - `Start Trip` → `Arrived at Restaurant` → `Picked Up` → `Arrived at Customer` → `Complete Delivery`
4. **Navigation**: Tap the navigation icons next to locations to open Google Maps
5. **Geofencing**: Move within 50 meters of locations to enable pickup/delivery buttons
6. **Track Progress**: Monitor your real-time location and distance to destinations

## 📋 Order Flow States

```
Assigned → Trip Started → At Restaurant → Picked Up → At Customer → Delivered
```

- **Geofence Protection**: "Arrived at Restaurant" and "Arrived at Customer" buttons only activate when within 50m
- **Real-time Distance**: Live distance calculation and display
- **Smart UI**: Buttons automatically enable/disable based on proximity

### Key Components
- **Models**: Data structures for orders and locations
- **Screens**: UI components for each app screen
- **Services**: Business logic for location, notifications, and order management  
- **Utils**: Enums and constants for app-wide usage

## 📦 Dependencies

This project uses only the allowed packages as specified in the assignment:

- **geolocator** `^10.1.0`: GPS location services, distance calculations, and geofencing
- **url_launcher** `^6.2.1`: Google Maps navigation integration and external URL handling
- **http** `^1.1.2`: (Optional) HTTP client for future API integration
- **flutter**: Core framework with null safety enabled

### Package Justification
- **geolocator**: Essential for real-time location tracking and 50m geofence validation
- **url_launcher**: Required for seamless Google Maps navigation integration
- **http**: Included for potential future backend connectivity (currently unused)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Location Service
- **Update Frequency**: Every 10 seconds
- **Accuracy**: High precision GPS
- **Permissions**: Automatic request handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management

### Geofencing Logic
- **Radius**: 50 meters for both restaurant and customer locations
- **Calculation**: Haversine distance formula via geolocator
- **Real-time**: Continuous distance monitoring
- **Debug Logging**: Verbose console output for verification

### State Management
- **Pattern**: StatefulWidget with enum-based state machine
- **Flow Control**: Linear progression through delivery stages
- **UI Updates**: Reactive interface based on location and state

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### UI/UX Choices
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent teal theme throughout
- **Layout**: Card-based design for clear information hierarchy
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with appropriate sizing
- **Interactions**: Intuitive button states (enabled/disabled)

### Architecture Choices
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between UI, business logic, and data
- **Service Pattern**: Dedicated LocationService for GPS operations
- **Model-View**: Clean data models with UI presentation separation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Login Flow**: Verify navigation from login to main screen
2. **Location Permissions**: Test permission request handling
3. **Geofencing**: Verify 50m radius detection accuracy
4. **Navigation**: Test Google Maps integration
5. **State Transitions**: Confirm proper order flow progression

### Device Testing
- **Physical Device**: Recommended for accurate GPS testing
- **Location Simulation**: Use emulator location features for development

## 📱 Demo Data

The app includes realistic demo data for testing:
- **Order ID**: ORD-12345
- **Restaurant**: Gourmet Burger Kitchen 
  - Address: 123 Main St, San Jose, CA
  - Coordinates: 37.190955, -121.749845 (San Jose area)
- **Customer**: Jane Doe
  - Address: 456 Oak Ave, San Jose, CA  
  - Coordinates: 37.195985, -121.743793 (San Jose area)
- **Order Amount**: $35.75
- **Distance**: ~600 meters between locations (perfect for geofence testing)

*Note: These coordinates are real locations in San Jose, CA for accurate GPS testing*

## 🔍 Debugging

### Location Debugging
The app includes comprehensive console logging:
```
📍 Location Update: Lat: XX.XXXX, Lng: XX.XXXX
--- GEOFENCE CHECK (Restaurant) ---
Current Position: XX.XXXX, XX.XXXX
Distance: XX meters
Can Arrive? true/false
```

### Common Issues
- **Location not updating**: Check device location permissions
- **Buttons not enabling**: Verify GPS accuracy and 50m proximity
- **Maps not opening**: Ensure Google Maps is installed
